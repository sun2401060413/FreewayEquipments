FreewayEquipments is an open-source package library designed for creating realistic freeway traffic simulation scenarios within the Unity engine. It provides a comprehensive set of features that enable the creation of immersive public road scenes, including the establishment of lifelike road networks, deployment of electromechanical devices, control of these devices, configuration of weather and lighting conditions, management of traffic flow, and generation of simulated traffic events.

Key Features:

- Scene Creation: Build detailed and accurate road networks, incorporating various road types, intersections, signage, and landmarks to replicate real-world environments.
- Electromechanical Device Deployment: Effortlessly place and configure electromechanical devices such as traffic lights, surveillance cameras, variable message signs, and other infrastructure elements.
- Device Control: Seamlessly control and interact with electromechanical devices within the simulated environment, enabling dynamic adjustments and behavior customization.
- Environment Configuration: Set up realistic weather conditions, including rain, fog, or sunshine, and adjust lighting environments to achieve desired visual effects and enhance scene realism.
- Traffic Flow Management: Define traffic rules, vehicle behavior, and traffic patterns to simulate various scenarios such as congestion, traffic signal synchronization, and emergency situations.
- Traffic Event Generation: Simulate diverse traffic events such as accidents, road closures, vehicle breakdowns, and emergency responses to enhance the authenticity of the simulated environment.
FreewayEquipments is highly extensible and compatible with other third-party package libraries, allowing users to integrate additional functionalities to meet their specific simulation requirements. With its intuitive interface and powerful capabilities, this open-source project aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in the field of freeway traffic management.
